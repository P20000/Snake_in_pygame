## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-sprite-game.git
   cd snake-sprite-game
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

4. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```

## 🔧 Cheat Mode (For Testing)

Uncomment the following line in `game_loop()` to disable collision:
```python
# if head in snake:  # Disable this check to cheat
```

## 📁 Assets

All sprites are loaded from a single sprite sheet (`snake-graphics.png`) and carefully extracted with coordinates. You can replace this sheet with your own artwork.
